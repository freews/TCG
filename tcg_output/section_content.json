They are:\n\n- Deploy Storage Device & Take Ownership: the Storage Device is integrated into its target system and ownership transferred by setting or changing the Storage Device’s owner credential.\n- Activate or Enroll Storage Device: LBA ranges are configured and data encryption and access control credentials (re)generated and/or set on the Storage Device. Access control is configured for LBA range unlocking.\n- Lock & Unlock Storage Device: unlocking of one or more LBA ranges by the host and locking of those ranges under host control via either an explicit lock or implicit lock triggered by a reset event. MBR shadowing provides a mechanism to boot into a secure pre-boot authentication environment to handle device unlocking.\n- Repurpose & End-of-Life: erasure of data within one or more LBA ranges and reset of locking credential(s) for Storage Device repurposing or decommissioning.\n\n**End of Informative Comment**",

In order to allow for alternative take ownership processes, the initial PIN column value of C_PIN_SID MAY be Vendor Unique (VU).\n\n**Start of Informative Comment**\n\nSeveral activation / take ownership models are possible. The simplest model, which is the only model supported by Opal v1.00, is a process whereby the host discovers the initial C_PIN_SID PIN value by performing a Get operation on the C_PIN_MSID object. This model requires that the initial C_PIN_SID PIN be the value of the C_PIN_MSID PIN.\n\nOpal v2.00 allows the initial C_PIN_SID PIN value to be vendor unique in order to allow for alternative activation / take ownership models. Such models require that the C_PIN_SID PIN be retrieved in a way that is beyond the scope of this specification.\n\nBefore a device vendor chooses to implement an activation / take ownership model based on a vendor unique SID PIN, the Storage Device vendor must undertake due diligence to ensure that the ecosystem exists to support such an activation / take ownership model. Having a C_PIN_SID PIN value that is different from the C_PIN_MSID PIN value may have serious ramifications, such as the inability to take ownership of the Storage Device.\n\nSee section 5.1.2.2.1 for an explanation of how the Revert method affects the value of the C_PIN_SID PIN column.\n\n**End of Informative Comment**",

This section defines extensions to [2] that allow a Storage Device to report the restrictions that it enforces when the host invokes the Set method on byte tables.\n\n**End of Informative Comment**",
