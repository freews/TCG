**Start of Informative Comment**

The LockingSP’s OFS could be either the Manufactured-Inactive or the Manufactured state. The Manufactured-to-Manufactured optional state transition may occur when the LockingSP’s OFS is the Manufactured state. In an implementation where the LockingSP’s OFS is the Manufactured state, then the Revert method would revert the LockingSP from Manufactured back to Manufactured while still reverting all LockingSP tables back to the OFS.

**End of Informative Comment**

Additional state transitions may exist depending on the states supported by the Storage Device and the SP’s Original Factory State. Invoking Revert or RevertSP (see sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.2.3) on the SP will cause the SP to transition back to its Original Factory State.

The Original Factory State of the Admin SP SHALL be Manufactured. The only state that is Mandatory for the Admin SP is Manufactured.

If the Locking SP is a Manufactured SP, then its Original Factory State SHALL be Manufactured-Inactive.

If the Locking SP is a Manufactured SP, then support for the states of Manufactured and Manufactured-Inactive are mandatory.

The other states in the state diagram are beyond the scope of this document.

## 5.2.2.1 State definitions for Manufactured SPs

1. **Manufactured-Inactive**: This is the Original Factory State for SPs that are created in manufacturing, where it is not desired for the functionality of that SP to be active when the TPER is shipped. All templates that exist in an SP that is in the Manufactured-Inactive state SHALL be counted in the Instances column of the appropriate objects in the Admin SP’s Template table. Sessions cannot be opened to SPs in the Manufactured-Inactive state. Only SPs whose Original Factory State was Manufactured-Inactive can return to the Manufactured-Inactive state.

2. **Manufactured**: This is the standard operational state of a Manufactured SP, and defines the initial required access control settings of an SP based on the Templates incorporated into the SP, prior to personalization.

The Manufactured state is Mandatory for the Admin SP.
