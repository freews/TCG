## 3.1.1.6.1 Data Removal Operation Processing Definition

The Data Removal Operation Processing bit SHALL be set to one if the TPer is performing any supported data removal operation including:

- Revert,
- RevertSP, or
- GenKey.

Otherwise, the Data Removal Operation Processing bit SHALL be set to zero. If the operation is in progress, the security transport commands such as the security send, and the security receive SHALL be processed by the Storage Device. The Data Removal Operation Processing bit SHALL be set to zero upon a successful completion of a data removal operation.

The Data Removal Operation Processing bit SHALL be set to one if the data removal operation is restarted after a Power Cycle (see Table 16).

## 3.1.1.6.2 Data Removal Operation Interrupted

The Data Removal Operation Interrupted bit SHALL be set to one if a previously issued data removal operation such as Revert, RevertSP or GenKey was interrupted for any reason (including, power loss, interface reset, etc.). The Data Removal Operation Interrupted bit SHALL be set to zero after successful completion of a data removal operation.

**Start of Informative Comment**

The host can reissue a data removal operation that was interrupted (such as RevertSP, Revert, or GenKey), The Storage Device can be in a locked state if the operation was interrupted and the Storage Device is now operational.
