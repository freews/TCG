If a Storage Device receives a read or write command that spans multiple Locking ranges and the Locking ranges are not locked, the Storage Device SHALL either:

- Process the data transfer as defined in [2], if Range Crossing Behavior bit is set to zero (in Level 0 Discovery Opal SSC V2 Feature, see section 3.1.1.5)  
  OR
- Terminate the command with “Other Invalid Command Parameter” as defined in [4], if Range Crossing Behavior bit is set to one (in Level 0 Discovery Opal SSC V2 Feature, see section 3.1.1.5).

## 4.3.8 Non Template Tables

### 4.3.8.1 DataStore (M)

The DataStore is a byte table. It can be used by the host for generic secure data storage. The DataStore table SHALL be at least 10MB in size (the Table table object that represents the DataStore table SHALL have a Rows column value of at least 0x00A00000). The access control for modification or retrieval of data in the table initially requires a member of the Admins class authority. These access control settings are personalizable. The Initial DataStore content value is VU.
