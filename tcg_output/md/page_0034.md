## 4.1.1.2 StartSession (M)

An Opal SSC compliant Storage Device SHALL support the following parameters for the StartSession method:

- HostSessionID
- SPID
- Write
- HostChallenge
- HostSigningAuthority

For an Opal SSC compliant Storage Device, a value of “True” for the Write parameter SHALL be supported.

For an Opal SSC compliant Storage Device, a value of “False” (i.e. read only session) for the Write parameter may or may not be supported.

The SessionTimeout parameter of the StartSession method is optional. It may be used by the host to specify a timeout value for the session. Refer to [2] for details.

If a TPer supports the optional SessionTimeout parameter and the parameter is included in the invocation of the StartSession method, then its value is permitted if it satisfies the following conditions:

a) It is less than or equal to the TPer’s MaxSessionTimeout property, the property is zero, or the property is not defined.

b) It is less than or equal to the value of the SPSessionTimeout column in the SP’s SPInfo table, the value is zero, or the column is empty; and

c) It is greater than or equal to the TPer’s MinSessionTimeout property, or the property is not defined.

If the specified SessionTimeout parameter value does not satisfy conditions a), b), and c) above, the TPer SHALL fail the StartSession method as defined in [2].
