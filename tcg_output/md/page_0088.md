### Table 45 - Locking SP - Locking Table Preconfiguration (continued) (continued)

|-----|--------|------|-------------|
| UID | Enable | Done | DoneOnReset |
| 00 00 08 03 00 00 00 01 | False | False | Power Cycle *MC1 |

## 4.3.5.2.2 LockOnReset Restrictions

The TPer SHALL support the following LockOnReset column values:

a) { 0 } (i.e. Power Cycle); and  
b) { 0, 3 } (i.e. Power Cycle and Programmatic).

Additionally, the TPer MAY support the following LockOnReset column values:

a) { 0, 1 } (i.e. Power Cycle and Hardware Reset); and  
b) { 0,1, 3 } (i.e. Power Cycle, Hardware Reset and Programmatic).

## 4.3.5.3 MBRControl (M)

The MBRControl table is defined in [2], and Table 46 defines the Preconfiguration Data for the MBRControl table.

*MC1 means that only a limited set of DoneOnReset values is required to be supported by Opal SSC compliant Storage Devices. Refer to section 4.3.5.3.1 for details.

### Table 46 - Locking SP - MBRControl Table Preconfiguration

|-----|--------|------|-------------|
| UID | Enable | Done | DoneOnReset |
| 00 00 08 03 00 00 00 01 | False | False | Power Cycle *MC1 |

## 4.3.5.3.1 DoneOnReset Restrictions

The TPer SHALL support the following DoneOnReset column values:

a) { 0 } (i.e. Power Cycle); and  
b) { 0, 3 } (i.e. Power Cycle and Programmatic).

When processing a Set method or CreateRow method on the Locking table for a non-Global Range row, if:

a) the AlignmentRequired column in the LockingInfo table is TRUE;  
b) RangeLength is non-zero; and  
c) LengthAlignment (see Figure 2) is non-zero,  
then the method SHALL fail and return an error status code INVALID_PARAMETER.

### Figure 2 - LengthAlignment Calculation

If RangeStart is zero, then  
  LengthAlignment = (RangeLength - LowestAlignedLBA) modulo AlignmentGranularity  

If RangeStart is non-zero, then  
  LengthAlignment = (RangeLength modulo AlignmentGranularity)  

where:  
LowestAlignedLBA and AlignmentGranularity are columns in the LockingInfo table (see section 4.3.5.1)
