## 1.3.4 Cell Shading and Font Legend for Preconfiguration Tables

The legend in Table 1 defines the Preconfiguration tables cell color coding, with the RGB values for the shading of each cell indicated in parentheses. This color coding is informative only. A Preconfiguration table cell content is normative. If a Preconfiguration table cell is empty or blank (regardless of shading), then the contents of that cell are not specified in this specification. The contents may be specified in another specification.
