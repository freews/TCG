- 0x00 = The C_PIN_SID PIN value becomes the value of the C_PIN_MSID PIN column after successful invocation of Revert on the Admin SP’s object in the SP table
- 0xFF = The C_PIN_SID PIN value changes to a VU value after successful invocation of Revert on the Admin SP’s object in the SP table, and MAY not be equal to the C_PIN_MSID PIN value
- 0x01 – 0xFE = Reserved

## Table 7 - SSC Minor Versions

If an Opal v2.00 SSC implementation is backward compatible with Opal v1.00, then the Storage Device SHALL also report the Opal SSC feature descriptor as defined in [5].

**Start of Informative Comment**  
An Opal v2.00 implementation is backward compatible to Opal v1.00 only if the geometry reported by the Geometry Reporting feature does not specify any alignment restrictions (i.e. ALIGN = FALSE, see section 3.1.1.4.2), and if the TPer does not specify any granularity restrictions for byte tables (i.e. MandatoryWriteGranularity = 1 for all byte tables, see section 5.3.1.1), and if the “Initial C_PIN_SID PIN Indicator” and “Behavior of C_PIN_SID PIN upon TPer Revert” fields are both 0x00.  
**End of Informative Comment**

## 3.1.1.5.1 Base ComID  
The Base ComID field provides the lowest static, pre-assigned ComID.

## 3.1.1.5.2 Number of ComIDs  
The Number of ComIDs field provides the number of static, pre-assigned ComIDs.

## 3.1.1.6 Supported Data Removal Mechanism Feature (Feature Code = 0x0404)  
This feature MAY be returned in the Level 0 Discovery response.
