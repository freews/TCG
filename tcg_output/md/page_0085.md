## 4.3.3 Crypto Template Tables
An Opal SSC compliant Storage Device is not required to support any Crypto template tables.

## 4.3.4 Crypto Template Methods
Refer to section 4.3.1.5 for supported methods.

## 4.3.4.1 Random
Refer to section 4.2.9.1 for additional constraints imposed on the Random method.

## 4.3.5 Locking Template Tables

## 4.3.5.1 LockingInfo (M)
The LockingInfo table has the columns defined in Table 43, in addition to those defined in [2]:

### Table 43 - Locking SP – LockingInfo Columns

|---------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Column Number | Column Name         | IsUnique | Column Type     |
| 0x07          | AlignmentRequired   |          | boolean         |
| 0x08          | LogicalBlockSize    |          | uinteger_4      |
| 0x09          | AlignmentGranularity|          | uinteger_8      |
| 0x0A          | LowestAlignedLBA    |          | uinteger_8      |

- **AlignmentRequired**  
  This column indicates whether the TPer requires ranges in the Locking table to be aligned (see section 4.3.5.2.1). If AlignmentRequired is TRUE, then the TPer requires ranges to be aligned. If AlignmentRequired is FALSE, then the TPer does not require ranges to be aligned.  
  This column SHALL NOT be modifiable by the host and MAY be retrieved by Anybody.

- **LogicalBlockSize**  
  This column indicates the number of bytes in a logical block.  
  This column SHALL NOT be modifiable by the host and MAY be retrieved by Anybody.

- **AlignmentGranularity**  
  This column indicates the number of logical blocks in a group, for alignment purposes (see section 5.4).  
  This column SHALL NOT be modifiable by the host and MAY be retrieved by Anybody.

- **LowestAlignedLBA**  
  This column indicates the lowest logical block address that is located at the beginning of an alignment granularity group (see section 5.4).  
  This column SHALL NOT be modifiable by the host and MAY be retrieved by Anybody.
