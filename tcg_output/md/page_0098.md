## 5.2.2.3.2 Manufactured

Behavior of an SP in the Manufactured state is identical to the behavior of an SP in the Issued state, as described in [2].

When the Locking SP is in the Manufactured state, the Locking SP’s management of the Storage Device’s locking and media encryption features SHALL be enabled.

## 5.2.3 Type Table Modification

In order to accommodate the additional life cycle states defined in this specification, the definition of the life_cycle_state type is changed from [2] to that described in Table 49:

### Table 49 - Life Cycle State Type Table Modification

## 5.3 Byte Table Access Granularity

**Start of Informative Comment**

While the general architecture defined in [2] allows data to be written into byte tables starting at any arbitrary byte boundary and with any arbitrary byte length, certain types of Storage Devices work more efficiently when data is written aligned to a larger block boundary. This section defines extensions to [2] that allow a Storage Device to report the restrictions that it enforces when the host invokes the Set method on byte tables.

**End of Informative Comment**

## 5.3.1 Table Table Modification

In order to allow a Storage Device to report its mandatory and recommended data alignment restrictions when accessing byte tables, the Table table SHALL contain the additional columns shown in Table 50.

The mandatory and recommended data alignment restrictions do not apply to Object tables.
